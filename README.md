I actively participate in sprint planning, bug triage, and post-deploy testing, helping teams build better products through solid QA practices. With a strong understanding of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), I aim to make testing a strategic part of the delivery process.

I’m fluent in English and work well in fully remote, distributed teams. I value clear communication, ownership, and continuous improvement — both in product quality and QA workflows.
